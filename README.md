# Simple Sudoku Solver

A simle Sudoku solver I put together written in C++.

To complie the C++ just run ```make``` from the top level directory.

To Run the tests run: ```make check``` from the top level directory.

To enter in a different Sudoku board you will need to add an array to the Main.cc file, change the board you are using in the Main function and recompile and run the Main application.  I may make a better interface at some point.
